# Regex_metadata

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Regex_metadata is to demonstrate how to use regex in conjunction with {stringr}, {data.table} and {tidyverse} libraries to extract meta deta from filenames, into a variable along with the data contained in the file.  

# Files  
The notebook `regex_meta.rmd` takes in as example two file names(from the 320 csv files of the engine test), and demonstrates how to extract the needed information from the file names.
